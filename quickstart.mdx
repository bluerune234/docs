# Quick Start

Get Wovly running and connected to your first integration in just a few minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Node.js 18+** - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
- **Git** - Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)
- **macOS, Windows, or Linux**
- An API key for at least one LLM provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google)

## Step 1: Clone and Install

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wovly/wovly.git
cd wovly

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the application
npm run dev
```

<Note>
  The first run may take a moment while dependencies are compiled. The app window will open automatically when ready.
</Note>

## Step 2: Create an Account

When Wovly opens:

1. Click **Create Account**
2. Enter a username and password
3. This creates a local profile on your machine (no cloud account needed)

<Tip>
  All data is stored locally on your device. Your credentials are never sent to any server.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Configure LLM Provider

Wovly needs an LLM (Large Language Model) to power its AI capabilities:

1. Go to **Settings** (gear icon in sidebar)
2. Under **AI Providers**, enter your API key for one of:
   - **Anthropic Claude** (recommended) - Get key at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
   - **OpenAI GPT** - Get key at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
   - **Google Gemini** - Get key at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com)

<Tip>
  Claude Sonnet is recommended for the best balance of capability and speed.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Connect Your First Integration

Go to the **Integrations** page (plug icon in sidebar) and connect at least one platform:

### Google Workspace (Gmail + Calendar)

1. Click **Connect** on Google Workspace
2. Enter your Google Cloud OAuth credentials (see [Google Workspace setup](/integrations/google-workspace))
3. Sign in with your Google account
4. Grant permissions for Gmail and Calendar access

### Slack

1. Click **Connect** on Slack
2. Follow the setup wizard to create a Slack app
3. Authorize Wovly to send messages as you

### iMessage (macOS only)

1. Click **Enable** on iMessage
2. Grant **Full Disk Access** in System Preferences → Privacy & Security
3. Grant **Contacts** access when prompted

## Step 5: Start Chatting

You're ready! Try these example requests:

```
"What's on my calendar today?"

"Email jeff@example.com about the meeting next week"

"Text Sarah happy birthday"

"Remind me to take my vitamins at 9am daily"
```
