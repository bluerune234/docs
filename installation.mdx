## Data Location

Wovly stores all data locally in `~/.wovly-assistant/`:

### Data Files

```
~/.wovly-assistant/
├── settings.json      # API keys, integration tokens
├── skills/            # Custom skill definitions
├── memory/
│   ├── daily/         # Daily conversation logs
│   └── longterm/      # Summarized history
└── tasks/             # Active and completed tasks
```

## Updating

Wovly will notify you when updates are available. To update:

1. Download the new version from GitHub Releases
2. Install over the existing version
3. Your data and settings are preserved

## Uninstalling

1. Drag Wovly from Applications to Trash
2. Optionally delete data: `rm -rf ~/.wovly-assistant`

## Build from Source

If you prefer to run from source or want to contribute:

```bash
# Prerequisites: Node.js 18+, Git

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wovly/wovly.git
cd wovly

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode (from root directory!)
npm run dev
```

<Warning>
  The `npm run dev` command must be run from the **root** `wovly/` directory, not from a subdirectory. This starts both the UI dev server and Electron together.
</Warning>

### Troubleshooting Development Mode

If `npm run dev` fails:

1. **Verify you're in the root directory**: `pwd` should show `.../wovly`
2. **Kill lingering processes**: `pkill -f "vite" ; pkill -f "electron"`
3. **Clear port conflicts**: `lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9`
4. **Run separately** if needed:
   - Terminal 1: `cd apps/ui && npm run dev`
   - Terminal 2: `cd apps/desktop && npm run dev`
